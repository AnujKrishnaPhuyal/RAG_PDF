RAG Model for PDF Query Answering
This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model is designed to enable efficient querying and answering from multiple PDF documents. The system combines advanced technologies to extract, embed, store, and infer contextual answers from a vast repository of PDFs.

Key Components:
1. PDF Ingestion and Preprocessing:
  The system supports multiple PDF uploads simultaneously.
  Text and metadata are extracted from PDFs using state-of-the-art parsing techniques to ensure accurate information retrieval.

2. Vector Embedding with Gemini:
   The extracted content is transformed into high-dimensional embeddings using Gemini, which ensures semantic representations of the text for better contextual 
   understanding.
   
3. Vector Database with Pinecone:
  Embeddings are stored in Pinecone, a high-performance vector database, allowing for efficient similarity search.
  Pinecone facilitates fast and scalable retrieval of relevant chunks of information based on user queries.

4. Inference with Groq:
  Groq accelerates inference by leveraging its high-speed processing capabilities to generate accurate and context-aware responses in real-time.
  Combines retrieved information with generative capabilities to construct precise answers.

Query Workflow:

a. Users input their queries through an intuitive interface.
b. The system retrieves relevant document chunks from Pinecone based on semantic similarity to the query.
c. Retrieved content is passed to the Groq-accelerated inference module, which generates an articulate and concise answer.

Applications:
1. Ideal for legal document review, academic research, enterprise knowledge management, and more.
2. Saves time by pinpointing relevant information from large, unstructured datasets.
